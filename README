About
=====

Allows TiddlyWeb users to Authenticate against an LDAP server.

This is work in progress, it's not in a working state yet.

Requirements
============

* [Python](http://www.python.org/)
* make
* A working TiddlyWeb instance to test against
* [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/) to run the tests.
* An LDAP server (e.g. [OpenLDAP](openldap.org)) with some users added (more on this to come).

Modifying
=========

`setup.py` is used to package up the plugin, install and distribute.

Plugin code lives in the `tiddlywebplugins` directory.

Tests live in the `test` directory.

`make test` runs the tests.  Currently there is just the one that
ensures the plugin can be imported.

`make install` installs the plugin as a package on your system
(you may need sudo for this.)

`make release` packages and uploads the plugin to [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) for distribution.

Usage
=====

Reference tje plugin from your TiddlyWeb configuration as an auth system plugin e.g:

`'auth_systems': ['tiddlywebplugins.ldapauth']`

The URL to authenticate with will be:

`challenge/tiddlywebplugins.ldapauth`
